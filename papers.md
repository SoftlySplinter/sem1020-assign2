## 2. [Rhythmic Brushstrokes Distinguish van Gogh fromHis Contemporaries: Findings via Automated Brushstroke Extraction](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~wangz/project/imsearch/ART/PAMI11/li.pdf)

> Art historians have long observed the highly characteristic brushstroke styles of Vincent van Gogh andhave relied on discerning these styles for authenticating anddating his works. In our work, we compared van Gogh with his contemporaries by statistically analyzing a massive set of automatically extracted brushstrokes. A novel extraction methodis developed by exploiting an integration of edge detection and clustering-based segmentation. Evidence substantiates that van Gogh's brushstrokes are strongly rhythmic. That is, regularly shaped brushstrokes are tightly arranged, creating a repetitive and patterned impression. We also found that the traits that distinguish van Gogh’s paintings in different time periods of his development are all different from those distinguishing van Gogh from his peers. This study confirms that the combined brushwork features identified as special to van Gogh are consistently held throughout his French periods of production (1886-1890).

## 3. [An Investigation of Multispectral Imaging for the Mapping of Pigments in Paintings](http://www.art-si.org/PDFs/Processing/PigmentMapping-Zhao2007.pdf)

> Compared with colorimetric imaging, multispectral imaging has the advantage of retrieving spectral reflectance factor of each pixel  of  a  painting.  Using  this  spectral  information,  pigment  mapping  is  concerned  with  decomposing  the spectrum into its constituent pigments and their relative contributions. The output of pigment mapping is a series of spatial  concentration  maps  of  the  pigments  comprising  the  painting.  This  approach  was  used  to  study  Vincent  van Gogh’s The Starry Night. The artist’s palette was approximated using ten oil pigments, selected from a large database of pigments used in oil paintings and a priori analytical research on one of his self portraits, executed during the same time period. The pigment mapping was based on single-constant Kubelka-Munk theory. It was found that the region of blue sky  where  the  stars  were  located  contained,  predominantly,  ultramarine  blue  while  the  swirling  sky  and  region surrounding the moon contained, predominantly, cobalt blue. Emerald green, used in light bluish-green brushstrokes surrounding  the  moon,  was  not  used  to  create  the  dark  green  in  the  cypresses.  A  measurement  of  lead  white  from Georges Seurat’s La Grande Jatte was used as the white when mapping The Starry Night. The absorption and scattering properties of this white were replaced with a modern dispersion of lead white in linseed oil and used to simulate the painting’s appearance before the natural darkening and yellowing of lead white oil paint. Pigment mapping based on spectral imaging was found to be a viable and practical approach for analyzing pigment composition, providing new insight into an artist’s working method, the possibility for aiding in restorative inpainting, and lighting design.

## 4. [A Digital Technique for Art Authentication](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~rockmore/pnas-rev.pdf)

> We describe a computational technique for authenticating works of art, specifically, paintings and drawings, from high resolution digital scans of the original works. This approach builds a statistical model of an artist from the scans of a set of authenticated works, against which new works are then compared. The statistical model consists of first - and higher - order wavelet statistics. We show preliminary results from our analysis of thirteen drawings that have at various times been attributed to Pieter Bruegel the Elder, which confirm expert authentications. We also apply these techniques to the problem of determining the number of artists that may have contributed to a painting attributed to Perugino and again achieve an analysis agreeing with expert opinion.

## 5. [When Van Gogh meets Mandelbrot: Multifractal classification of painting's texture](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165168412000308)

> Recently, a growing interest has emerged for examining the potential of Image Processing tools to assist Art Investigation. Simultaneously, several research works showed the interest of using multifractal analysis for the description of homogeneous textures in images. In this context, the goal of the present contribution is to study the benefits of using the wavelet leader based multifractal formalism to characterize paintings. After a brief review of the underlying key theoretical concepts, methods and tools, two sets of digitized paintings are analyzed. The first one, the Princeton Experiment, consists of a set of seven paintings and their replicas, made by the same artist. It enables examination of the potential of multifractal analysis in forgery detection. The second one is composed of paintings by Van Gogh and contemporaries, made available by the Van Gogh and Kröller-Müller Museums (Netherlands) in the framework of the Image processing for Art Investigation research program. It enables us to show various differences in the regularity of textures of Van Gogh's paintings from different periods, or between Van Gogh's and contemporaries' paintings. These preliminary results plead for the constitution of interdisciplinary research teams consisting of experts in art, image processing, mathematics and computer sciences.

## 6. [Image Fusion for Difference Visualization in Art Analysis](http://library.utia.cas.cz/separaty/2013/ZOI/blazek-0398593.pdf)


> A new method for difference visualization is pre- sented, oriented on the art analysis application. Compared images are combined into one fused image without losing important image context. Dissimilar regions are highlighted by color, which encodes localized differences. The method was developed for comparison of artwork copies, but it can be applied for general image comparison, too. The method is based on diverging color maps. The color representation of the difference is comprehensi- ble, naturally ordered, and has maximal displayable resolution. The applicability of the method is demonstrated on hierarchy ordering of the copies of the ”A boy with a bird” painting by Mons Bernardo (1624-1687).

## 7. [Can Mathematical Tools Illuminate Artistic Style?](http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=34)

> Mathematicians often wring their hands and lament the lack of stories about mathematical research in the popular press. Yet in December, dozens of media outlets, including The New York Times and Wired, ran lengthy news stories on a rather technical paper involving mathematical tools for digital image processing. Why did this story attract attention when so many others have not?
