## [Rhythmic Brushstrokes Distinguish van Gogh fromHis Contemporaries: Findings via Automated Brushstroke Extraction](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~wangz/project/imsearch/ART/PAMI11/li.pdf)

> Art historians have long observed the highly characteristic brushstroke styles of Vincent van Gogh andhave relied on discerning these styles for authenticating anddating his works. In our work, we compared van Gogh with his contemporaries by statistically analyzing a massive set of automatically extracted brushstrokes. A novel extraction methodis developed by exploiting an integration of edge detection and clustering-based segmentation. Evidence substantiates that van Gogh's brushstrokes are strongly rhythmic. That is, regularly shaped brushstrokes are tightly arranged, creating a repetitive and patterned impression. We also found that the traits that distinguish van Gogh’s paintings in different time periods of his development are all different from those distinguishing van Gogh from his peers. This study confirms that the combined brushwork features identified as special to van Gogh are consistently held throughout his French periods of production (1886-1890).

# [An Investigation of Multispectral Imaging for the Mapping of Pigments in Paintings](http://www.art-si.org/PDFs/Processing/PigmentMapping-Zhao2007.pdf)

> Compared with colorimetric imaging, multispectral imaging has the advantage of retrieving spectral reflectance factor of each pixel  of  a  painting.  Using  this  spectral  information,  pigment  mapping  is  concerned  with  decomposing  the spectrum into its constituent pigments and their relative contributions. The output of pigment mapping is a series of spatial  concentration  maps  of  the  pigments  comprising  the  painting.  This  approach  was  used  to  study  Vincent  van Gogh’s The Starry Night. The artist’s palette was approximated using ten oil pigments, selected from a large database of pigments used in oil paintings and a priori analytical research on one of his self portraits, executed during the same time period. The pigment mapping was based on single-constant Kubelka-Munk theory. It was found that the region of blue sky  where  the  stars  were  located  contained,  predominantly,  ultramarine  blue  while  the  swirling  sky  and  region surrounding the moon contained, predominantly, cobalt blue. Emerald green, used in light bluish-green brushstrokes surrounding  the  moon,  was  not  used  to  create  the  dark  green  in  the  cypresses.  A  measurement  of  lead  white  from Georges Seurat’s La Grande Jatte was used as the white when mapping The Starry Night. The absorption and scattering properties of this white were replaced with a modern dispersion of lead white in linseed oil and used to simulate the painting’s appearance before the natural darkening and yellowing of lead white oil paint. Pigment mapping based on spectral imaging was found to be a viable and practical approach for analyzing pigment composition, providing new insight into an artist’s working method, the possibility for aiding in restorative inpainting, and lighting design.

## [A Digital Technique for Art Authentication](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~rockmore/pnas-rev.pdf)

> We describe a computational technique for authenticating works of art, specifically, paintings and drawings, from high resolution digital scans of the original works. This approach builds a statistical model of an artist from the scans of a set of authenticated works, against which new works are then compared. The statistical model consists of first - and higher - order wavelet statistics. We show preliminary results from our analysis of thirteen drawings that have at various times been attributed to Pieter Bruegel the Elder, which confirm expert authentications. We also apply these techniques to the problem of determining the number of artists that may have contributed to a painting attributed to Perugino and again achieve an analysis agreeing with expert opinion.
