SEM1020 Survey Paper
====================

The main assessment in SEM1020 and CHM1320 is a survey paper, which accounts for 60% of the assessment for the module.

A survey paper is a paper in which you look at a field and collect information from many different sources. Ideally, after reading a survey paper, a person with little experience will have a basic idea of the academic field and what people are working on. In a survey paper, you do not put much in the way of personal opinion, although you should bring the material together and draw some conclusions at the end.

The survey paper may address any aspect of Software Engineering. The survey paper should be approximately 9,000 words long, and must conform to the specifications of the IEEE (see http://www.ieee.org/web/publications/authors/transjnl/index.html).
